	under PER. They were not being set on the correct object causing
	decode failures (usually via assert).

	as a PWLib channel. Primarily this is for allow read from stdin to

	Fixed ugly little bug in the cooperative multithreading that meant 
	that threads blocked on timers didn't always get rescheduled.

	problems on TCP/IP stuff getting a packet for the first byte and then
	another pacet for the rest of the buffer.

	Fixed race condition in doing Select() on closed sockets. Could go 
	into infinite wait.

	Added ability to open file as standard input, output and error streams.
