Release 1.08
------------

	Fixed bug causing crashes on pass through of unknown extensions in
	PER encoding.

	Fixed race condition on indirect channel close, mutex needed in
	PIndirectChannel.

	under MS Windows.

Release 1.07
------------

	Improved tracing yet again. Now has options for adding timestamps,
	thread ID etc to the trace output as well as the file/line number.

	Fixed bug in the output code in ASN compiler for string constraints
	under PER. They were not being set on the correct object causing
	decode failures (usually via assert).

	Added PConsoleChannel class to allow access to stdin/stdout/stderr
	as a PWLib channel. Primarily this is for allow read from stdin to
	not block the cooperative multithreading.

	set to '0'. Also ignored stream width parameter.


Release 1.06
------------

	Added better User Interface to make files.

	Major ASN Parser enhancements for parameterised types etc.

	Fixed problems with decoding of extensions (signed/unsigned bug) 
	in ASN PER.

	Fixed date parsing to be forgiving of rubbish at end of date string.
	Fixed problem with not stopping date parse at end of line.
	Fixed PTime::GetHour() etc to not crash on time=-1.

	Fixed ugly little bug in the cooperative multithreading that meant 
	that threads blocked on timers didn't always get rescheduled.

	Changed channel output flush to remove double Write() call. This caused
	problems on TCP/IP stuff getting a packet for the first byte and then
	another pacet for the rest of the buffer.

	Added retries to DNS lookup if get temporary error.

	Fixed race condition in doing Select() on closed sockets. Could go 
	into infinite wait.

	Added ability to open file as standard input, output and error streams.

	Added function to get default audio device.

	Added initialisers to string containers (list, sorted list and set).


Release 1.05
------------

	Changed build to allow for 64 bit processors (Alpha port).

	Minor changes to support egcs compiler.

	Added SIGHUP and SIGWINCH handlers to increase and decrease the log
	level respectively in a service (daemon) application.

Release 1.04
------------

	Large numbers of changes to support automated documentation system
	doc++.

	Simultaneous MSVC 6 and MSVC 5 compatibility.

	Improved trace facility adding trace levels and #define to remove all
	trace code.

	Various BeOS port modifications.

	Fixed bug in IP access control lists compatibility with unix
	hosts.allow and hosts.deny files.

	Added [] operator PIPSocket::Address to get the bytes out of an IP
	address.

Release 1.03
------------

Very slack in not producing histories for earlier versions.
