 * $Log: pwavfile.h,v $
 * Revision 1.10  2002/05/21 01:56:53  robertj
 * Removed the enum which made yet another set of magic numbers for audio
 *   formats, now uses the WAV file format numbers.
 * Fixed failure to write header when destroying object without and explicit
 *   call to Close().
 * Fixed missing Open() function which does not have file name parameter.
 * Added ability to set the audio format after construction.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2002/01/22 03:55:07  craigs
 * Added #define guards when file moved to PTCLib
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2002/01/13 21:00:41  rogerh
 * The type of new .WAV files must now be specified in the class constructor.
 * Take out Open() function from the last commit and create a new Open()
 * function which replaces the one in the PFile base class.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2002/01/11 16:33:46  rogerh
 * Create a PWAVFile Open() function, which processes the WAV header
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2001/10/16 13:27:37  rogerh
 * Add support for writing G.723.1 WAV files.
 * MS Windows can play G.723.1 WAV Files in Media Player and Sound Recorder.
 * Sound Recorder can also convert them to normal PCM format WAV files.
 * Thanks go to M.Stoychev <M.Stoychev@cnsys.bg> for sample WAV files.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/10/15 11:48:15  rogerh
 * Add GetFormat to return the format of a WAV file
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/07/23 01:20:20  rogerh
 * Add updates from Shawn - ensure isvalidWAV is false for zero length files.
 * GetDataLength uses actual file size to support file updates as well as appends.
 * Add updates from Roger - Update Header() just writes to specific fields which
 * preserves any 'extra' data in an existing header between FORMAT and DATA chunks.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/07/20 07:06:27  rogerh
 * Fix a typo
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/07/20 03:30:59  robertj
 * Minor cosmetic changes to new PWAVFile class.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/07/19 09:55:48  rogerh
 * Add PWAVFile, a class to read and write .wav files, written by
 * Roger Hardiman and <roger@freebsd.org> and
 * Shawn Pai-Hsiang Hsiao <shawn@eecs.harvard.edu>
