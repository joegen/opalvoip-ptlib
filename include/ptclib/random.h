/**Mersenne Twister random number generator.
   An application would create a static instance of this class, and then use
   if to generate a sequence of psuedo-random numbers.

   Usually an application would simply use PRandom::Number() but if
   performance is an issue then it could also create a static local variable
   such as:
        {
          static PRandom rand;
          for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
             array[i] = rand;
        }

    This method is not thread safe, so it is the applications responsibility
    to assure that its calls are single threaded.
