// File Specification

/**This class describes a full description for a file on the particular
   platform. This will always uniquely identify the file on currently mounted
   volumes.

   An empty string for a PFilePath indicates an illegal path.

   The ancestor class is dependent on the platform. For file systems that are
   case sensitive, eg Unix, the ancestor is <code>PString</code>. For other
   platforms, the ancestor class is <code>PCaselessString</code>.
