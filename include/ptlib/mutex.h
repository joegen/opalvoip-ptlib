PDECLARE_CLASS(PMutex, PSemaphore)
/* This class defines a thread mutual exclusion object. A mutex is where a
   piece of code or data cannot be accessed by more than one thread at a time.
   To prevent this the PMutex is used in the following manner:
      <CODE>
      PMutex mutex;

      ...

      mutex.Wait();

      ... critical section - only one thread at a time here.

      mutex.Signal();

      ...
      </CODE>
    The first thread will pass through the <A>Wait()</A> function, a second
    thread will block on that function until the first calls the
    <A>Signal()</A> function, releasing the second thread.
 */

  public:
    PMutex();
    /* Create a new mutex.
