/**
   Abstract class for a generalised sound channel, and an implementation of
   PSoundChannel for old code that is not plugin-aware.
   When instantiated, it selects the first plugin of the base class 
   "PSoundChannel"

   As an abstract class, this represents a sound channel. Drivers for real, 
   platform dependent sound hardware will be ancestors of this class and 
   can be found in the plugins section of PTLib.

   A sound channel is either playing or recording. If simultaneous
   playing and recording is desired, two instances of PSoundChannel
   must be created. It is an error for the same thread to attempt to
   both read and write audio data to once instance of a PSoundChannel
   class.

   PSoundChannel instances are designed to be reentrant. The actual
   usage model employed is left to the developer. One model could be
   where one thread is responsible for construction, setup, opening and 
   read/write operations. After creating and eventually opening the channel
   this thread is responsible for handling read/writes fast enough to avoid
   gaps in the generated audio stream.

   Remaining operations may beinvoked from other threads.
   This includes Close() and actually gathering the necessary data to
   be sent to the device.

   Besides the basic I/O task, the Read()/Write(() functions have well
   defined timing characteristics. When a PSoundChannel instance is
   used from Opal, the read/write operations are designed to also act
   as timers so as to nicely space the generated network packets of
   audio/ sound packets to the speaker.


   Read and Writes of audio data to a PSoundChannel are blocking. The
   length of time required to read/write a block of audio from/to a
   PSoundChannel instance is equal to the time required for that block
   of audio to record/play. So for a sound rate of 8khz, 240 samples,
   it is going to take 30ms to do a read/write.

   Since the Read()/Write(() functions have well defined
   timing characteristics; they are designed to also act as timers in a loop
   involving data transfers to/from the codecs.

   The sound is buffered and the size and number of buffers should be set
   before playing/recording. Each call to Write() will use one buffer, so care
   needs to be taken not to use a large number of small writes but tailor the
   buffers to the size of each write you make.

   Similarly for reading, an entire buffer must be read before any of it is
   available to a Read() call. Note that once a buffer is filled you can read
   it a byte at a time if desired, but as soon as all the data in the buffer
   is used, the next read will wait until the entire next buffer is
   read from the hardware. So again, tailor the number and size of buffers to
   the application. To avoid being blocked until the buffer fills, you can use
   the StartRecording() function to initiate the buffer filling, and the
   IsRecordingBufferFull() function to determine when the Read() function will
   no longer block.

   Note that this sound channel is implicitly a linear PCM channel. No data
   conversion is performed on data to/from the channel.
