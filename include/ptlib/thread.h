///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// PThread

/** This class defines a thread of execution in the system. A {\it thread} is
   an independent flow of processor instructions. This differs from a
   {\it process} which also embodies a program address space and resource
   allocation. So threads can share memory and resources as they run in the
   context of a given process. A process always contains at least one thread.
   This is reflected in this library by the #PProcess# class being
   descended from the PThread class.

   The implementation of a thread is platform dependent. Not all platforms
   support concurrent threads within a process or even concurrent processes!
   For example, MS-DOS has no form of multi-threading or multi-processing,
   Microsoft Windows has a cooperative multi-processing but no multi-threading.
   Unix has full pre-emptive multi-processing but most cannot do multiple
   threads within that process while some Unix systems and Windows NT have
   full preemptive proceses and threads.

   If a platform does not directly support multiple threads, the library will
   them using a cooperative co-routine technique. This requires that each
   thread of execution within a process, voluntarily yields control to other
   threads. This will occur if the thread is blocked inside an I/O function
   on a #PChannel# or when the #PThread::Yield()# function is
   explicitly called.
   
   Note that this is {\bf cooperative}. An endless loop will stop all
   threads in a process, possibly all processes on some platforms. If a
   lengthy operation is to take place that does not involve blocking I/O,
   eg pure computation or disk file I/O, then it is the responsiblity of the
   programmer to assure enough yielding for background threads to execute.

    /** Create a new thread instance. Unless the #startSuspended#
       parameter is TRUE, the threads #Main()# function is called to
       execute the code for the thread.
       
       Note that the exact timing of the execution of code in threads can
       never be predicted. Thus you you can get a race condition on
       intialising a descendent class. To avoid this problem a thread is
       always started suspended. You must call the Resume() function after
       your descendent class construction is complete.

       If synchronisation is required between threads then the use of
       semaphores is essential.

       If the #deletion# is set to #AutoDeleteThread#
       then the PThread is assumed to be allocated with the new operator and
       may be freed using the delete operator as soon as the thread is
       terminated or executes to completion (usually the latter).

       The stack size specified is {\bf not} simply in bytes. It is a value

       significantly more stack than an MS-DOS platform. These sizes are
       normalised to the "stack factor" provided here. For some platforms, eg
