/*! \mainpage  map_dictionary 

The purpose of this program is to find out which is faster:
\li STL based map
\li PTLib based dictionary

By default, this program creates the 200 instances of the structure Element.
Each instance of the Element class is given a random (and hopefully) unique key.
The key can exist either as a string, or as a number.

Each instance of the class Element has a key to the next instance.

After creation of an instance of the class Element, it is put into a
map (or PDictionary), keyed of the random key.

Then, the code looks through the map (or PDictionary) for each created
instance. Since the code knows the first key, it can get the key of
the next element via the current element. In this way, the code is
made to make N acceses to seemingly random parts of the map (or
PDictionary).

Results so far indicate that when the key is integer, STL map is
always faster - by a factor of four or more.

When the key is a PString, STL map is only faster when there are more
than 1000 elements in the map.

/**This class is the core of the thing. It is placed in the structure

   element. Since the key to the next element is random, any code that
   follows this ends up walking over the entire map/directory in a
   random fashion */
