/*! \mainpage  SyncPoints 

The purpose of this program is to find out which is faster:
\li windows
\li linux

when dealing with waiting on SyncPoints. PTLib provides the structure,
PSyncPoint. One programming approach is to have a thread wait on a
PSyncPoint instance. When the PSyncPoint instance is signalled, the
waiting thread should be activated to do things.

This program creates a PThread derivative, that contains a PSyncPoint instance.
There are N instances of the derivative. 

The first instance signals the second. The second instance signals the
third. And so on. The time taken to move the signalling along the
queue to end is record. Since this program runs on windows and linux,
we can compare the two times. Maybe, issues in linux scheduling can be
exposed..


Results so far indicate that a linux AMD dual core box will take 6
microseconds for a thread to respond to a syncpoint signal. this time
was recorded when the box was running at 100% cpu load, with both
processors doing a compile. When the machine was idle, the average
time per syncpoint was 4.7 microseconds.

If there are far fewer syncpoints made (just 1, loops of 10000) the
time was (unloaded box) 2.2 microseconds per sync point. With this
test set, and loading the box, the time was between 2 and 35
microseconds.
